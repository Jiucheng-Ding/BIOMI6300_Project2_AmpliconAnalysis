Hi! This is the readme file.
This file provides a general outline of the project.
The data contains the amplicons of the sample collected from hot spring 
outflow channels. What I want to perform here is to determine the inpact 
of pH and temperature acting on the diversity of species in spring water 
in Yellowstone.There will be potentially more factors to be added into my 
analysis.

I am expecting a lower diversity of microbe growth in relatively extreme 
pH conditions,and extremely temperature (thermophilic species). PCoA will 
be perform to assess the gradients of the constructed plane and eventually 
make the conclusions.
