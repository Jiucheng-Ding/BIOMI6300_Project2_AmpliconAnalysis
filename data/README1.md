The DNA was sequenced for both bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene 
amplicons at Arizona State Universitys Biodesign Institute using Illumina 
MiSeq v2 2x300 chemistry with the Earth Microbiome Project primers 505F 
and 806R (Thompson et al., 2017).

Study: The Characterization of Microbiomic and Geochemical Compositions 
Across the Photosynthetic Fringe.
